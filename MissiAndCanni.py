# Here, 3 - m is the numburr of missionaries on the opposite side, and 3 - c is the number of cannibals on that side.

# 3 - m == 0 allows all missionaries to have crossed, in which case it doesnâ€™t matter how many cannibalsex are there.

# 3 - m >= 3 - c ensures that missionaries are not outnumbered by cannibalsex on the opposite side.
